# kure

Kure is a blogging engine written in PHP. It runs on a flat-file database, meaning it stores its posts and information in straight-up text files rather than database systems.

Kure sports a templating engine to suit your styling needs and a plugin engine to suit your mechanical ones.

Kure is built to be simple, portable, and easy to understand.

Kure is currently in beta.

For more information, check out the faq.
