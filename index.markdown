<p>Kure is a blogging engine written in PHP. It runs on a flat-file database, meaning it stores its posts and information in straight-up text files rather than database systems.</p>

<p>Kure sports a templating engine to suit your styling needs and a plugin engine to suit your mechanical ones.</p>

<p>Kure is built to be simple, portable, and easy to understand.</p>

<p>Kure is currently in beta.</p>
