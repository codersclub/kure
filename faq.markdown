#### Tell me more about this flat-file thing.

Typically websites store information in advanced database systems like MySQL or Oracle. The concept of a flat-file database instead uses plain text files to store information.

#### This method has its disadvantages, of course, but it is both extremely portable and, in many cases, very simple to understand.

For instance, if you wanted to you could open up Kure's posts directory and see all the posts you've made as text files. You can open them and change them just as you would a normal text file without messing anything up in the process. This is one of the appealing simplicities of the flat-file structure.
