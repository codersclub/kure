<p class="q">Tell me more about this flat-file thing</b>.</p> 
<p class="a">Typically websites store information in advanced database systems like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MySQL">MySQL</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oracle_Database">Oracle</a>. The concept of a flat-file database instead uses plain text files to store information.</p> 

<p class="a">This method has its disadvantages, of course, but it is both extremely portable and, in many cases, very simple to understand.</p> 
<p class="a">For instance, if you wanted to you could open up Kure's <tt>posts</tt> directory and see all the posts you've made as text files. You can open them and change them just as you would a normal text file without messing anything up in the process. This is one of the appealing simplicities of the flat-file structure.
